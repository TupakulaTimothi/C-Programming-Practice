/*
sudha owns 2 cars. she wishes to sell them over 2 years by selling exactly one car per year. The price of first and second
car are p1=5 unit and p2=10 units. deu to depreciation the price of first car decreases by d1=3 units and second car
price decreses by d2=2 units per year until it is sold. note that the price of a car cannot drop below 0.
when the price of a car reaches 0 in some year, it remains 0 in all subsequent years. find the maximum profit sudha can
make if she sells her cars in an optimal way.
