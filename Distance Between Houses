/*
Google is recruting software engineers to calculate distance between the coordinates of two
buildings in google maps. some buildings do not have coordinates but have distances to nearest buildings. if the coordinates of two buildings - A is (1,1),B is (2,3) and Building C is 2kms away from Building B.
find the length of the path from A to C via B.

input:distances
output:distance from A to C
