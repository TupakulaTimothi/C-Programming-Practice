/* anshu moved to a new house in vijayawad from hyderabad. she was arranging her
things in the selves provided. she has a box that has a mass of 12.786 pounds. she lifted
the box and placed it on shelf. if the box gains 125j of potential energy,
how high is the shelf? (HINT: Acceleration due to gravity g=9.8 m/sec2 PE=mass*g*height and HINT: 1kg=2.2046 pounds)

input:gravity,mass,potential energy
output:liters left
